# Using Dagster with DuckDB

This tutorial focuses on creating and interacting with DuckDB tables using Dagster's [Software-defined Assets (SDAs)](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets).

The `dagster-duckdb` library provides two ways to interact with DuckDB tables:
- [Resource](/concepts/resources): The resource allows you to directly run SQL queries against tables within an asset's compute function. Available resources: <PyObject module="dagster_duckdb" object="DuckDBResource" />.
- [I/O manager](/concepts/io-management/io-managers): The I/O manager transfers the responsibility of storing and loading DataFrames as DuckdB tables to Dagster. Available I/O managers: <PyObject module="dagster_duckdb_pandas" object="DuckDBPandasIOManager" />, <PyObject module="dagster_duckdb_pyspark" object="DuckDBPySparkIOManager" />, <PyObject module="dagster_duckdb_polars" object="DuckDBPolarsIOManager" />.

This tutorial is divided into two sections to demonstrate the differences between the DuckDB resource and the DuckDB I/O manager. Each section will create the same assets, but the first section will use the DuckDB resource to store data in DuckDB, whereas the second section will use the DuckDB I/O manager. When writing your own assets, you may choose one or the other (or both) approaches depending on your storage requirements. See [When to use I/O managers](/concepts/io-management/io-managers#when-to-use-io-managers) to learn more about when to use I/O managers and when to use resources.

In [Option 1](#option-1-using-the-duckdb-resource) you will:

- Set up and configure the DuckDB resource.
- Use the DuckDB resource to execute a SQL query to create a table.
- Use the DuckDB resource to execute a SQL query to interact with the table.


In [Option 2](#option-2-using-the-duckdb-io-manager) you will:

- Set up and configure the DuckDB I/O manager.
- Use Pandas to create a DataFrame, then delegate responsibility creating a table to the DuckDB I/O manager.
- Use the DuckDB I/O manager to load the table into memory so that you can interact with it using the Pandas library.

When writing your own assets, you may choose one or the other (or both) approaches depending on your storage requirements. See [When to use I/O managers](/concepts/io-management/io-managers#when-to-use-io-managers) to learn more.

By the end of the tutorial, you will:

- Understand how to interact with a DuckDB database using the DuckDB resource.
- Understand how to use the DuckDB I/O manager to store and load DataFrames as DuckDB tables.
- Understand how to define dependencies between assets corresponding to tables in a DuckDB database.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- **To install the `dagster-duckdb` and `dagster-duckdb-pandas` libraries**:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster-duckdb dagster-duckdb-pandas
  ```

---

## Part 1: Using the DuckDB resource

### Step 1: Configure the DuckDB resource

To use the DuckDB resource, you'll need to add it to your `Definitions` object. The DuckDB resource requires some configuration. You must set a path to a DuckDB database as the `database` configuration value. If the database does not already exist, it will be created for you:

```python file=/integrations/duckdb/tutorial/resource/configuration.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
from dagster_duckdb import DuckDBResource

from dagster import Definitions

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[iris_dataset],
    resources={
        "duckdb": DuckDBResource(
            database="path/to/my_duckdb_database.duckdb",  # required
        )
    },
)
```

### Step 2: Create tables in DuckDB

<TabGroup>

<TabItem name="Create DuckDB tables in Dagster">

#### Create DuckDB tables in Dagster

Using the DuckDB resource, you can create DuckDB tables using the DuckDB Python API:

```python file=/integrations/duckdb/tutorial/resource/create_table.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
import pandas as pd
from dagster_duckdb import DuckDBResource

from dagster import asset


@asset
def iris_dataset(duckdb: DuckDBResource) -> None:
    iris_df = pd.read_csv(
        "https://docs.dagster.io/assets/iris.csv",
        names=[
            "sepal_length_cm",
            "sepal_width_cm",
            "petal_length_cm",
            "petal_width_cm",
            "species",
        ],
    )

    with duckdb.get_connection() as conn:
        conn.execute("CREATE TABLE iris.iris_dataset AS SELECT * FROM iris_df")
```

In this example, you're defining an asset that fetches the Iris dataset as a Pandas DataFrame and renames the columns. Then, using the DuckDB resource, the DataFrame is stored in DuckDB as the `iris.iris_dataset` table.

</TabItem>

<TabItem name="Make existing tables available in Dagster">

#### Make existing tables available in Dagster

If you already have tables in DuckDB, you may want to have other assets in Dagster depend on those tables. You can accomplish this by creating [source assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#defining-external-asset-dependencies) for these tables.

```python file=/integrations/duckdb/tutorial/io_manager/source_asset.py
from dagster import SourceAsset

iris_harvest_data = SourceAsset(key="iris_harvest_data")
```

In this example, you're creating a <PyObject object="SourceAsset" /> for a pre-existing table called `iris_harvest_data`.

</TabItem>

</TabGroup>

Now you can run `dagster dev` and materialize the `iris_dataset` asset from the Dagster UI.

### Step 3: Define downstream assets

Once you have created an asset or source asset that represents a table in DuckDB, you will likely want to create additional assets that work with the data.

```python file=/integrations/duckdb/tutorial/resource/downstream.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
from dagster import asset

# this example uses the iris_dataset asset from Step 1


@asset(deps=[iris_dataset])
def iris_setosa(duckdb: DuckDBResource) -> None:
    with duckdb.get_connection() as conn:
        conn.execute(
            "CREATE TABLE iris.iris_setosa AS SELECT * FROM iris.iris_dataset WHERE"
            " species = 'Iris-setosa'"
        )
```

In this asset, you're creating second table that only contains the data for the _Iris Setosa_ species. This asset has a dependency on the `iris_dataset` asset. To define this dependency, you provide the `iris_dataset` asset as the `deps` parameter to the `iris_setosa` asset. You can then run the SQL query to create the table of _Iris Setosa_ data.

### Completed code example

When finished, your code should look like the following:

```python file=/integrations/duckdb/tutorial/resource/full_example.py
import pandas as pd
from dagster_duckdb import DuckDBResource

from dagster import Definitions, SourceAsset, asset

iris_harvest_data = SourceAsset(key="iris_harvest_data")


@asset
def iris_dataset(duckdb: DuckDBResource) -> None:
    iris_df = pd.read_csv(
        "https://docs.dagster.io/assets/iris.csv",
        names=[
            "sepal_length_cm",
            "sepal_width_cm",
            "petal_length_cm",
            "petal_width_cm",
            "species",
        ],
    )

    with duckdb.get_connection() as conn:
        conn.execute("CREATE TABLE iris.iris_dataset AS SELECT * FROM iris_df")


@asset(deps=[iris_dataset])
def iris_setosa(duckdb: DuckDBResource) -> None:
    with duckdb.get_connection() as conn:
        conn.execute(
            "CREATE TABLE iris.iris_setosa AS SELECT * FROM iris.iris_dataset WHERE"
            " species = 'Iris-setosa'"
        )


defs = Definitions(
    assets=[iris_dataset],
    resources={
        "duckdb": DuckDBResource(
            database="path/to/my_duckdb_database.duckdb",
        )
    },
)
```

## Part 2: Using the DuckDB I/O manager

You may want to use an I/O manager to handle storing DataFrames as tables in DuckDB and loading DuckDB tables as DataFrames in downstream assets. Using an I/O manager is not required, and you can reference [When to use I/O managers](/concepts/io-management/io-managers#when-to-use-io-managers) to learn more.

This section of the guide focuses on storing and loading Pandas DataFrames in DuckDB, but Dagster also supports using PySpark and Polars DataFrames with DuckDB. The concepts from this guide apply to working with PySpark and Polars DataFrames, and you can learn more about setting up and using the DuckDB I/O manager with PySpark and Polars DataFrames in the [reference guide](/integrations/duckdb/reference).

### Step 1: Configure the DuckDB I/O manager

To use the DuckDB I/O, you'll need to add it to your `Definitions` object. The DuckDB I/O manager requires some configuration to connect to your database. You must provide a path where a DuckDB database will be created. Additionally, you can specify a `schema` where the DuckDB I/O manager will create tables.

```python file=/integrations/duckdb/tutorial/io_manager/configuration.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
from dagster_duckdb_pandas import DuckDBPandasIOManager

from dagster import Definitions

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[iris_dataset],
    resources={
        "io_manager": DuckDBPandasIOManager(
            database="path/to/my_duckdb_database.duckdb",  # required
            schema="IRIS",  # optional, defaults to PUBLIC
        )
    },
)
```

### Step 2: Create tables in DuckDB

The DuckDB I/O manager can create and update tables for your Dagster-defined assets, but you can also make existing DuckDB tables available to Dagster.

<TabGroup>

<TabItem name="Create tables in DuckDB from Dagster assets">

#### Store a Dagster asset as a table in DuckDB

To store data in DuckDB using the DuckDB I/O manager, you can simply return a Pandas DataFrame from your asset. Dagster will handle storing and loading your assets in DuckDB.

```python file=/integrations/duckdb/tutorial/io_manager/basic_example.py
import pandas as pd

from dagster import asset


@asset
def iris_dataset() -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.read_csv(
        "https://docs.dagster.io/assets/iris.csv",
        names=[
            "sepal_length_cm",
            "sepal_width_cm",
            "petal_length_cm",
            "petal_width_cm",
            "species",
        ],
    )
```

In this example, you're defining an asset that fetches the Iris dataset as a Pandas DataFrame, renames the columns, then returns the DataFrame. The type signature of the function tells the I/O manager what data type it is working with, so it is important to include the return type `pd.DataFrame`.

When Dagster materializes the `iris_dataset` asset using the configuration from [Step 1: Configure the DuckDB I/O manager](#step-1-configure-the-duckdb-io-manager), the DuckDB I/O manager will create the table `IRIS.IRIS_DATASET` if it does not exist and replace the contents of the table with the value returned from the `iris_dataset` asset.

</TabItem>

<TabItem name="Make existing tables available in Dagster">

#### Make an existing table available in Dagster

If you already have tables in DuckDB, you may want to make them available to other Dagster assets. You can accomplish this by using [source assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#defining-external-asset-dependencies) for these tables. By creating a source asset for the existing table, you tell Dagster how to find the table so it can be fetched for downstream assets.

```python file=/integrations/duckdb/tutorial/io_manager/source_asset.py
from dagster import SourceAsset

iris_harvest_data = SourceAsset(key="iris_harvest_data")
```

In this example, you're creating a <PyObject object="SourceAsset" /> for a pre-existing table containing iris harvests data. To make the data available to other Dagster assets, you need to tell the DuckDB I/O manager how to find the data.

Because you already supplied the database and schema in the I/O manager configuration in [Step 1: Configure the DuckDB I/O manager](#step-1-configure-the-duckdb-io-manager), you only need to provide the table name. This is done with the `key` parameter in `SourceAsset`. When the I/O manager needs to load the `iris_harvest_data` in a downstream asset, it will select the data in the `IRIS.IRIS_HARVEST_DATA` table as a Pandas DataFrame and provide it to the downstream asset.

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

### Step 3: Load DuckDB tables in downstream assets

Once you have created an asset or source asset that represents a table in DuckDB, you will likely want to create additional assets that work with the data. Dagster and the DuckDB I/O manager allow you to load the data stored in DuckDB tables into downstream assets.

```python file=/integrations/duckdb/tutorial/io_manager/load_downstream.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
import pandas as pd

from dagster import asset

# this example uses the iris_dataset asset from Step 2


@asset
def iris_setosa(iris_dataset: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return iris_dataset[iris_dataset["species"] == "Iris-setosa"]
```

In this asset, you're providing the `iris_dataset` asset as a dependency to `iris_setosa`. By supplying `iris_dataset` as a parameter to `iris_setosa`, Dagster knows to use the `DuckDBPandasIOManager` to load this asset into memory as a Pandas DataFrame and pass it as an argument to `iris_setosa`. Next, a DataFrame that only contains the data for the _Iris Setosa_ species is created and returned. Then the `DuckDBPandasIOManager` will store the DataFrame as the `IRIS.IRIS_SETOSA` table in DuckDB.

### Completed code example

When finished, your code should look like the following:

```python file=/integrations/duckdb/tutorial/io_manager/full_example.py
import pandas as pd
from dagster_duckdb_pandas import DuckDBPandasIOManager

from dagster import Definitions, SourceAsset, asset

iris_harvest_data = SourceAsset(key="iris_harvest_data")


@asset
def iris_dataset() -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.read_csv(
        "https://docs.dagster.io/assets/iris.csv",
        names=[
            "sepal_length_cm",
            "sepal_width_cm",
            "petal_length_cm",
            "petal_width_cm",
            "species",
        ],
    )


@asset
def iris_setosa(iris_dataset: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return iris_dataset[iris_dataset["species"] == "Iris-setosa"]


defs = Definitions(
    assets=[iris_dataset, iris_harvest_data, iris_setosa],
    resources={
        "io_manager": DuckDBPandasIOManager(
            database="path/to/my_duckdb_database.duckdb",
            schema="IRIS",
        )
    },
)
```
